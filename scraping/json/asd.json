    "description": "Today, we are all, voluntarily or involuntarily, surrounded by objects and built environments driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI). This phenomenon has not only led to the automation of designs themselves, but more fundamentally, the automation of design cognition and the optimization of aesthetic imaginations for our cultural futures. If architects and designers are to continue in playing their roles as cultural producers, social activists and technological imaginaries, a holistic understanding of today\u2019s AI systems is essential. Such a foundational knowledge will provide the much-needed historical and theoretical bases for critically reassessing the current nature of design processes and reframing the future culture of architecture and design. The course will begin by tracing the fascinating and intertwined genealogies of artificial intelligence and architectural intelligence from the 1960s onwards. This history will be vividly brought forth to the present with complementary readings on AI aesthetics, AI artists and other emerging AI design topics, such as adversarial-based design algorithms, post-truth redesign of visual culture, unsolicited algorithmic cultivation of collective design tastes, and the territorial politics of computer vision-based surveillances. Beyond the \u2018critical writing\u2019 of AI & Design, students will also work in groups to speculate \u2018critical designs\u2019 based on their newly acquired perspectives on the culture and nature of artificial designs. The deliverables are in the forms of design mock-ups, visual diagrams and written texts.\n",

    "description": "The development of a building design to its actual construction is not a predetermined process. Each architectural design is an autonomous and unique scenario demanding a high level of creative invention supported by current and responsible technological knowledge. This understanding of the technology of assemblies should be less a mere familiarity with devices and products but rather, a working understanding of the forces, both general and specific, that affect the performance of building systems and the architecture. With this understanding, architects and engineers can then design physical assemblies and systems that both respond to and collaborate with these forces. The eventual humanity and beauty of any architectural construct is an almost pure reflection of the depth of both the thought of and individual, and the highly complex interactions of a collective effort. This course intends for the full depth of design possibilities to unfold and be revealed, not constrained, as technological issues are introduced. The building technology sequence in the core curriculum terms begins with an introduction to the performance requirements, physics and physical phenomena and construction systems of contemporary buildings. The intention of this class will be to link the diversity of physical forces relevant to building performance to the materials, components, assemblies and large scale systems that control and direct these forces and guide performance. This introduction will be phased to deliver to the entering Architecture and Sustainable Design student key concepts and essential analytical skills necessary for the rigorous selection and design of structural systems, enclosure and fa\u00e7ade systems, environmental and energy systems, and circulation and interior systems. The scope of the class includes these major systems to an intermediate level of understanding and an introductory level of analysis and system design. Subsequent classes in the building technologies will build on all four systems in both detail complexity and integrative depth.\nThis class is an introduction to the science and physics of building design and performance and an understanding of contemporary building construction methods, materials, and technical information necessary for a responsible making of a humane built environment. It is also intended as an introduction to the historical foundations and cultural contexts in which construction technologies have been developed over time. The focus of the class will be put on an understanding of tectonic principles: the materials and components that comprise buildings, their relationship to the manufacturing processes, and the forces and physical phenomenon of performance requirements. Beyond that there will also be a substantial discussion of the environmental consequences of the construction and operation of the built environment. While the scope of the course is broad, it is not, and could never be, a comprehensive treatment of all issues regarding the design and construction of buildings. However, the course will address all of the primary forces that determine the configuration, materials and processes of construction and the integration of building systems into the completed whole.\n",

    "description": "This seminar course teaches natural and electric lighting in an architectural context. Students will learn the scientific basis of light and visual perception in order to apply them to the design of two course projects: the design and construction of an electric light fixture (luminaire) and the comprehensive lighting design of a large communal gathering space with integrated electric and daylight systems. Individual activities and lectures focus on lighting measures and metrics, calibrated high dynamic range photography, daylight simulations, material properties, visual comfort / perception, electric lighting design, lighting energy consumption, scale model building and human behavior.\n",

    "description": "Far from isolated trajectories, new ideas, scientific discoveries, technology innovation, and aesthetic avant-gardes occur in a highly interconnected manner. Complex dynamics between architectural designs and their cultural and technological contexts attest that architecture is not fully autonomous as it serves, negates, distorts, questions and produces its context. The course analyzes the development of contemporary architecture through its relationships with technological and scientific advances. The course is roughly organized in a chronological format, starting with a brief overview of the industrial revolution and the early 20th century, placing emphasis on the second half of the 20th century and the development of current digital culture in architecture.\nStudents develop an understanding of the relationships between architectural design, technology innovation and scientific ideas that led to contemporary architectural practice and theory. In this course, architectural design is placed into a broader intellectual context, which helps students not only understand the \u201cwhat and how\u201d architects do but also build perspective and framework to reflect on the \u201cwhys\u201d.\n",
