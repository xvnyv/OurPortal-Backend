      "This course introduces innovative product design methods and techniques in the crosscultural contexts. In this course, we focus on consumer products (used or consumed by ordinary end users rather than professionals), including physical products and computer software.  The first part of the course will introduce empathetic design approach, targeting at designing for niche market. Using this artistic approach, designers is mainly driven by their intrinsic motivations. Some techniques of design semiotics will be taught and students are expected to do some souvenir design on the basis of Singaporean cultural elements.  The second part targets at cross-cultural design for the mass market. In collaboration with Alibaba international UED team, we will explore an emerging virtual place for intercultural communication and interactions, mobile commerce applications (m-Commerce apps). In this case, designs are mainly driven by extrinsic requirements. How to understand and response to users from different cultural backgrounds will be a huge challenge for designers. Students will be guided to detach from their own cultural viewpoints, and be sensitive to intercultural differences. Equipped with basic marketing and user study techniques, students are required to do a cross-cultural analysis for products or mobile apps. The insights gained from the cross-cultural user studies will then guide students to finish their course project: designing a cross-cultural m-Commerce app.",

The brief occupation of Southeast Asia (1941-45) during WWII was a complex phenomenon involving the complicity of many Asian nationalist leaders. While it did contribute to the unravelling of European colonial rule, it was at a tragic human cost, the ethics and gore of which are still debated both in academia and in popular media. Through scholarly texts, memoirs, fiction film (The Burmese Harp, Bridge on the River Kwai) and archival newsreels, this course will explore those tumultuous years in Burma, Indochina, Malaya, Indonesia, and the Philippines.

During the term, we’ll track the figure of Satan in the Western world, from Genesis to Roman Polanski’s films—with substantial time dedicated to discussions of Milton’s epic poem about the Fall, Paradise Lost.\nWe’ll begin with some of the world’s oldest texts containing the story of Satan’s temptation of Adam and Eve; these scriptural and apocryphal works span the Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions. The remainder of the semester will provide you with opportunities to read some of the most powerful responses to these stories about humankind’s Fall from divine grace—with a focus on authors and artists from England, America, and Russia. We’ll discuss the implication of the reimagined Satan’s role as an avatar or mouthpiece for the religious, sexual, political, or racial anxieties of his specific historical epoch. In the process, we’ll ask how Satan—as archetype and personae—contributes to each of these meditations about human shortcoming, erotic longing, the quest for knowledge, and unbridled ambition. Whether as arch-enemy, Vice figure, Machiavellian villain, tragic hero, romantic idealist, intellectual skeptic, or as a facet of oneself, Satan—reimagined in two millennia of visual art, literature, and culture—embodies the qualities that strike us foremost as distinctly humane.\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.",

Can one make a ‘real’ documentary film with a smart phone? This course provides an overview of the evolution and practice of non-fiction cinema and trains students both in film appreciation and production. We shall critically analyze the development of this shape-shifting genre over the past hundred years and consider the significance of this cinematic form in contemporary society. Ethnographic theory will be utilized toward a practical application (making a film), and contextualized within emerging trends in the Digital Humanities.

      "In this class, we’ll read short poems spanning 500 years of modernity—from the Renaissance sonnet to the 21st century Twitter poem. The focus of this class is tripartite: first, it provides students with an opportunity to explore the role that poetry has played in modern society and culture. To this end, we’ll read practicing poets on the purposes of poetry—from Sir Philip Sidney to contemporary Singaporean poets.\nAdditionally, we’ll also look at the way poets from a range of cultures and historical moments have used poetry to comment upon questions of perennial importance. Can poems help us think about what it means to create a well-run city? And how we can live a flourishing life? In weekly modules, we will read about three to five poets on topics such as the roles of children and parents, an individual’s place within the family and the city, love, religion, politics, and technology. The majority of these poems will be written in English, with a few in translation from Chinese, Malay, Tamil, and other languages.\nFinally, we’ll also discuss the formal features of poetry—with lessons on prosody, form, meter, rhyme, tone, and imagery. These features constitute what an engineering student might term the “architectural and design studies” of poetry. We’ll study the formal structures and techniques that enable poems to convey meaning—what the poet Marianne Moore calls “a place for the genuine.”\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.",

      "The advances in the development of the so-called Artificial Intelligence (AI) have started to raise ethical problems. These problems are of different kinds: on the one hand philosophers and scientists have started asking whether computers, once they reach a certain level of intelligence comparable with human beings, should be granted certain rights. On the other hand, there is the question of how to regulate AI in such a way that, in the pursuits of its goals, it be harmful to human beings.\nIn this course we will analyze these questions in order to 1) check their assumptions and understand on what kind of presuppositions these very assumptions are based, 2) try to elaborate new ways to approach the so-called AI and to formulate more productive questions out of a deeper understanding of the phenomenon.\nIn this course students will become aware of the state of the debate around AI as well as to enable them to formulate hypotheses that can propose a different approach to the problem. In order to do so, we will study the philosophical roots of the understanding of “intelligence” as well as of the “machine” that lies as the foundation of the way in which we currently think about AI. We will at the same time contrast this understanding with another hypothesis on what “intelligence” is.The ultimate goal of the course is to enable students to start developing an understanding of the actual potentials of computers that might go beyond the current one.\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.",

      "A.I. is the new frontier of technological progress. But far from being just another tool, A.I. has the potential to change the way in which we relate to the world and in which we understand ourselves. Yet, A.I. remains a human product and as such it is the result of a certain way in which human beings have interpreted themselves and the world through the course of history. In relation to this long cultural path, A.I. represents one of the possibilities through which the human being can relate to things and to itself.\nIn this course we want students to become aware of 1) the cultural passages that have led to the development of A.I., 2) the different possibilities present in those cultural passages, 3) the theoretical assumptions that are at the core of the way in which A.I. is being thought and developed.\nThe course is going to be co-taught by a philosopher, Dr. Paolo Di Leo, and an engineer, Prof. Costas Courcoubetis. This collaboration is going to ensure that while the theoretical and cultural aspects of A.I. are explored, attention be devoted also to the more specialized technical aspects, so that discussions and observations may be grounded on solid facts.\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.",

      "When designers create something– whether an algorithm, a user interface, a technological device, a building, or a new urban plan – they actively intervene into the lived world of its users. But both designers and users are human beings enmeshed in varied social, cultural, and political worlds. As such, they bring different ideas and assumptions about things like value, beauty, social order, power, morality, and ethics into their creative and practical activities, including their reception or uptake of a designed form, object, space, or system. By focusing on the diversity and variability of human experience, the discipline of anthropology is well-situated to interrogate design as socio-culturally mediated act of human creativity. Issues like the formation of design problems through community engagement, the cultural embeddedness and historical novelty of a design process, empathy with users, and analysis and anticipation of user experiences (UX) all hinge on anthropological sensibilities and methods. To that end, this class develops an anthropological approach to design, which can equally inform how social scientists understand design and design processes, as well as designers’ and engineers’ reflexive and critical approaches to their own practices. For instance, how does qualitative engagement with people’s lived circumstances contribute to the formation of a design problem? How can designers try to anticipate unexpected critiques or problems with their design before they happen? How do political values, assumptions about social organization, moral goodness, and power get built into designs? How might a holistic view of social life inform the ethical commitments of designers in releasing a designed artifact, object, or entity into the world? What exactly are creativity and innovation, and are these even possible without a certain level of historical and cultural awareness?  Through curated readings and activities, this class provides students with the conceptual tools and analytical skills with which to reflexively engage with design, design thinking, and design processes as social and cultural phenomena. It introduces current and emerging ideas in design anthropological theory and practice, and explores how sensitive, ethical, and innovative design relies on social, historical, and cultural knowledge.\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.\nAccess to Course Syllabus\n(Please ensure that you login to the eDimension portal before clicking the link)",

      "This course is designed to build an understanding of how organizations behave and change by analyzing the workplace through different perspectives (or lenses).\nThe ability to act with skill and creativity in organizations begins with the development of multiple perspectives on organizations. Humans habitually settle into fixed perspectives, unchallenged mental models of how the world works, unconscious filters determining what we pay attention to and what we ignore. These habits offer powerful economies of thought: without them, the simplest task of picking a face out in a crowd or listening to the radio while driving would be impossible. But they impose ‘costs’ as well. They lock us into a single view of the world that may not be best, that is surely incomplete, resistant to change, and will become outdated. Overcoming organizational challenges requires the discipline of interpreting what we see and hear in organizations from multiple standpoints.\nAs a starting point, this course is organized around three different perspectives on organizations: the strategic design perspective, the cultural perspective, and the political perspective. Each of them offers a different angle on what is an organization, and each offers different ‘tools for action’. People naturally populate these organizations. Accordingly, we will probe some of the psychological and social processes that are at work in organizations. We will then turn to a more in‐depth treatment of the strategic design, political, and cultural perspectives on organization, and examine the implications of these insights for understanding the prospects and challenges of working in organizations.\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.",

      "This course introduces students to the social scientific study of human-environment interactions through the history and culture of a single agricultural crop: rice. The cultivation of rice dates back almost 10,000 years in Asia, and forms the core of an independent origin of civilization, distinct from other Eurasian sites that were all based around wheat/barley and millet. Some scholars hypothesize that the cultivation of rice also supports a distinctive Asian form of society, and mode of historical or technological development, that differs from standard frameworks of ‘Western’ modernization. Today rice is one of the most intensively researched crops, as both a model organism for advanced research in genomics and an important object of genetic modification experiments. We will explore how the cultivation of rice raises exciting and provocative questions about the relationships among society, technology and environment. The course asks whether Asia’s history and culture of rice can provide an alternative figure of technological development and design, and perhaps a model for a sustainable relationship between humans and their natural environments.\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.",

If architects and designers are to continue in playing their roles as cultural producers, social activists and technological imaginaries, a holistic understanding of today’s AI systems is essential. Such a foundational knowledge will provide the much-needed historical and theoretical bases for critically reassessing the current nature of design processes and reframing the future culture of architecture and design. The course will begin by tracing the fascinating and intertwined genealogies of artificial intelligence and architectural intelligence from the 1960s onwards. This history will be vividly brought forth to the present with complementary readings on AI aesthetics, AI artists and other emerging AI design topics, such as adversarial-based design algorithms, post-truth redesign of visual culture, unsolicited algorithmic cultivation of collective design tastes, and the territorial politics of computer vision-based surveillances. Beyond the ‘critical writing’ of AI & Design, students will also work in groups to speculate ‘critical designs’ based on their newly acquired perspectives on the culture and nature of artificial designs.

      "The development of a building design to its actual construction is not a predetermined process. Each architectural design is an autonomous and unique scenario demanding a high level of creative invention supported by current and responsible technological knowledge. This understanding of the technology of assemblies should be less a mere familiarity with devices and products but rather, a working understanding of the forces, both general and specific, that affect the performance of building systems and the architecture. With this understanding, architects and engineers can then design physical assemblies and systems that both respond to and collaborate with these forces. The eventual humanity and beauty of any architectural construct is an almost pure reflection of the depth of both the thought of and individual, and the highly complex interactions of a collective effort. This course intends for the full depth of design possibilities to unfold and be revealed, not constrained, as technological issues are introduced. The building technology sequence in the core curriculum terms begins with an introduction to the performance requirements, physics and physical phenomena and construction systems of contemporary buildings. The intention of this class will be to link the diversity of physical forces relevant to building performance to the materials, components, assemblies and large scale systems that control and direct these forces and guide performance. This introduction will be phased to deliver to the entering Architecture and Sustainable Design student key concepts and essential analytical skills necessary for the rigorous selection and design of structural systems, enclosure and façade systems, environmental and energy systems, and circulation and interior systems. The scope of the class includes these major systems to an intermediate level of understanding and an introductory level of analysis and system design. Subsequent classes in the building technologies will build on all four systems in both detail complexity and integrative depth.\nThis class is an introduction to the science and physics of building design and performance and an understanding of contemporary building construction methods, materials, and technical information necessary for a responsible making of a humane built environment. It is also intended as an introduction to the historical foundations and cultural contexts in which construction technologies have been developed over time. The focus of the class will be put on an understanding of tectonic principles: the materials and components that comprise buildings, their relationship to the manufacturing processes, and the forces and physical phenomenon of performance requirements. Beyond that there will also be a substantial discussion of the environmental consequences of the construction and operation of the built environment. While the scope of the course is broad, it is not, and could never be, a comprehensive treatment of all issues regarding the design and construction of buildings.

Students will emerge from this course with a thorough understanding of modern canonical design philosophies in conjunction with a more concise understanding of what forces govern the growth and development of their nascent design ethos.\n",

      "The course provides an overview of today’s machine learning apparatus for generative design and in turn speculates on the ways in which architectural design process itself might be altered as a result of this epistemological shift towards a ‘Software 2.0’ paradigm. By situating the discourse within an experimental prototyping context, students will not only gain the practical experience of applied machine learning workflow, but more importantly the architectural sensibility to conceptualize, articulate and implement their design applications in relation to these state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. Students are expected to work in small groups, curating and preparing the dataset; selecting and training the machine learning model; and finally generating designs from the learnt data distribution. The deliverables are in the forms of a design prototype and a written report, which could be used for future exhibition and publications.\n",

      "Augmented Reality has crossed a significant threshold in its development with the recent introduction of hardware and programming kits such as the HoloLens and ARCore/ARKit respectively. It is now more accessible to end-users who may wish to adopt this technology for their specific domain purposes. The moment is ripe for architects, who comprise one such group of end-users, to explore the potentials of AR and critically evaluate where it can be used to enhance established workflows.\nIf AR does indeed have the potential to disrupt how architecture is currently conceived, represented and materialized, then it would be critical to expose students to such technology. This elective course will furnish students with conceptual and technical knowledge, enabling them to explore how AR can be utilized at various stages of the design to production process. Furthermore, it will build upon topics introduced earlier in the core syllabus relating to computation and fabrication.\nThe objective of this course is to ensure students become adroit users of AR, as well as to contribute and possibly shape the nascent discourse around this technology in the architectural domain.\n",

      "The course is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between Architecture and Sustainable Design and Engineering Product Development. It brings together material science and digital fabrication, fusing natural composites with industrial robotics, aiming to produce innovation in the realm of sustainable design and manufacturing. It suggests that designs inspired by biological processes found in nature, may assist in transforming society toward a more environmentally benign mode of production from the ground up. This process starts from the understanding of the principles behind structural biological systems and the development of tools embracing the paradigm imposed by nature instead of those predefined by the existing manufacturing technologies. As a research and design course, students are required to develop their own proposals, methods and artifact which may lead to publication of results in journals and conferences.\n",

Students will develop an understanding of a building’s relationship to its site’s natural systems; the building enclosure’s ability to mitigate outdoor conditions; passive systems for conditioning and lighting; mechanical heating, cooling and ventilation strategies; lighting and daylighting opportunities; site and building water cycles; and health and well-being, and advanced building and environmental system simulation through a series of lectures and workshops.\nCase studies will be introduced based on the lecture themes. Topics are discussed based on the physical laws that govern the exchange of energy between building and environment and how they relate to human comfort. The ability and confidence in making both quantitative and qualitative statements about building performance will help students in integrating these considerations into their future architecture and urban design work. Ultimately students will be able to understand the impact of their design decisions on building performance in order to mitigate the carbon footprint.\nWorkshops throughout the semester will be a series of design exercise and environmental design studies as well as calculations, which will serve as supporting documents for the final carbon-neutral project at the end of the semester.\nPre-requisite: 20.203 Architectural Energy Systems\n",

Investigating the interdependencies evolving between a building’s entity and its urban territory students will speculate how strategies for urban building types have contributed in the past and can contribute in the future to urban development.\nParticipants will understand the relevance of housing typology research and the potentials of designer’s repositories of known housing precedents as design expertise. Having gained a clear understanding of concepts like ‘type’ and ‘typology’ students will analyze both contemporary and historical housing precedents of building types like Block Enclosure, Urban Infill, Solitaire, Superblock, Apartment Tower, Residential Estate and Urban Row Houses. With these building types as typically evolving within and due to specific contextual conditions the investigations will make essential connections to a building’s territory, its urban type, its historical and economical context, its density and programs.\nBeyond discussing precedents as a typological knowledge on merely immutable built physical forms the course will also investigate the potential of operational building strategies like incrementalism, usage flexibility and neutrality, and user participation for sustainable urban communities. Both autochthonous building types and contemporary precedents with a particular focus on sustainable building performance will be another focus.\n",

Complex dynamics between architectural designs and their cultural and technological contexts attest that architecture is not fully autonomous as it serves, negates, distorts, questions and produces its context. The course analyzes the development of contemporary architecture through its relationships with technological and scientific advances. The course is roughly organized in a chronological format, starting with a brief overview of the industrial revolution and the early 20th century, placing emphasis on the second half of the 20th century and the development of current digital culture in architecture.\nStudents develop an understanding of the relationships between architectural design, technology innovation and scientific ideas that led to contemporary architectural practice and theory. In this course, architectural design is placed into a broader intellectual context, which helps students not only understand the “what and how” architects do but also build perspective and framework to reflect on the “whys”.\n",
