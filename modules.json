In this course, we focus on consumer products (used or consumed by ordinary end users rather than professionals), including physical products and computer software.  The first part of the course will introduce empathetic design approach, targeting at designing for niche market. Using this artistic approach, designers is mainly driven by their intrinsic motivations. Some techniques of design semiotics will be taught and students are expected to do some souvenir design on the basis of Singaporean cultural elements.  The second part targets at cross-cultural design for the mass market. In collaboration with Alibaba international UED team, we will explore an emerging virtual place for intercultural communication and interactions, mobile commerce applications (m-Commerce apps). In this case, designs are mainly driven by extrinsic requirements. How to understand and response to users from different cultural backgrounds will be a huge challenge for designers. Students will be guided to detach from their own cultural viewpoints, and be sensitive to intercultural differences. Equipped with basic marketing and user study techniques, students are required to do a cross-cultural analysis for products or mobile apps. The insights gained from the cross-cultural user studies will then guide students to finish their course project: designing a cross-cultural m-Commerce app.",

The remainder of the semester will provide you with opportunities to read some of the most powerful responses to these stories about humankind’s Fall from divine grace—with a focus on authors and artists from England, America, and Russia. We’ll discuss the implication of the reimagined Satan’s role as an avatar or mouthpiece for the religious, sexual, political, or racial anxieties of his specific historical epoch. In the process, we’ll ask how Satan—as archetype and personae—contributes to each of these meditations about human shortcoming, erotic longing, the quest for knowledge, and unbridled ambition. Whether as arch-enemy, Vice figure, Machiavellian villain, tragic hero, romantic idealist, intellectual skeptic, or as a facet of oneself, Satan—reimagined in two millennia of visual art, literature, and culture—embodies the qualities that strike us foremost as distinctly humane.\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.",

To this end, we’ll read practicing poets on the purposes of poetry—from Sir Philip Sidney to contemporary Singaporean poets.\nAdditionally, we’ll also look at the way poets from a range of cultures and historical moments have used poetry to comment upon questions of perennial importance. Can poems help us think about what it means to create a well-run city? And how we can live a flourishing life? In weekly modules, we will read about three to five poets on topics such as the roles of children and parents, an individual’s place within the family and the city, love, religion, politics, and technology. The majority of these poems will be written in English, with a few in translation from Chinese, Malay, Tamil, and other languages.\nFinally, we’ll also discuss the formal features of poetry—with lessons on prosody, form, meter, rhyme, tone, and imagery. These features constitute what an engineering student might term the “architectural and design studies” of poetry. We’ll study the formal structures and techniques that enable poems to convey meaning—what the poet Marianne Moore calls “a place for the genuine.”\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.",

These problems are of different kinds: on the one hand philosophers and scientists have started asking whether computers, once they reach a certain level of intelligence comparable with human beings, should be granted certain rights. On the other hand, there is the question of how to regulate AI in such a way that, in the pursuits of its goals, it be harmful to human beings.\nIn this course we will analyze these questions in order to 1) check their assumptions and understand on what kind of presuppositions these very assumptions are based, 2) try to elaborate new ways to approach the so-called AI and to formulate more productive questions out of a deeper understanding of the phenomenon.\nIn this course students will become aware of the state of the debate around AI as well as to enable them to formulate hypotheses that can propose a different approach to the problem. In order to do so, we will study the philosophical roots of the understanding of “intelligence” as well as of the “machine” that lies as the foundation of the way in which we currently think about AI. We will at the same time contrast this understanding with another hypothesis on what “intelligence” is.The ultimate goal of the course is to enable students to start developing an understanding of the actual potentials of computers that might go beyond the current one.\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.",

    "title": "Design Anthropology",
    "description": "When designers create something– whether an algorithm, a user interface, a technological device, a building, or a new urban plan – they actively intervene into the lived world of its users. But both designers and users are human beings enmeshed in varied social, cultural, and political worlds. As such, they bring different ideas and assumptions about things like value, beauty, social order, power, morality, and ethics into their creative and practical activities, including their reception or uptake of a designed form, object, space, or system. By focusing on the diversity and variability of human experience, the discipline of anthropology is well-situated to interrogate design as socio-culturally mediated act of human creativity. Issues like the formation of design problems through community engagement, the cultural embeddedness and historical novelty of a design process, empathy with users, and analysis and anticipation of user experiences (UX) all hinge on anthropological sensibilities and methods. To that end, this class develops an anthropological approach to design, which can equally inform how social scientists understand design and design processes, as well as designers’ and engineers’ reflexive and critical approaches to their own practices. For instance, how does qualitative engagement with people’s lived circumstances contribute to the formation of a design problem? How can designers try to anticipate unexpected critiques or problems with their design before they happen? How do political values, assumptions about social organization, moral goodness, and power get built into designs? How might a holistic view of social life inform the ethical commitments of designers in releasing a designed artifact, object, or entity into the world? What exactly are creativity and innovation, and are these even possible without a certain level of historical and cultural awareness?  Through curated readings and activities, this class provides students with the conceptual tools and analytical skills with which to reflexively engage with design, design thinking, and design processes as social and cultural phenomena. It introduces current and emerging ideas in design anthropological theory and practice, and explores how sensitive, ethical, and innovative design relies on social, historical, and cultural knowledge.\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.\nAccess to Course Syllabus\n(Please ensure that you login to the eDimension portal before clicking the link)",

    "description": "This course is designed to build an understanding of how organizations behave and change by analyzing the workplace through different perspectives (or lenses).\nThe ability to act with skill and creativity in organizations begins with the development of multiple perspectives on organizations. Humans habitually settle into fixed perspectives, unchallenged mental models of how the world works, unconscious filters determining what we pay attention to and what we ignore. These habits offer powerful economies of thought: without them, the simplest task of picking a face out in a crowd or listening to the radio while driving would be impossible. But they impose ‘costs’ as well. They lock us into a single view of the world that may not be best, that is surely incomplete, resistant to change, and will become outdated. Overcoming organizational challenges requires the discipline of interpreting what we see and hear in organizations from multiple standpoints.\nAs a starting point, this course is organized around three different perspectives on organizations: the strategic design perspective, the cultural perspective, and the political perspective. Each of them offers a different angle on what is an organization, and each offers different ‘tools for action’. People naturally populate these organizations. Accordingly, we will probe some of the psychological and social processes that are at work in organizations. We will then turn to a more in‐depth treatment of the strategic design, political, and cultural perspectives on organization, and examine the implications of these insights for understanding the prospects and challenges of working in organizations.\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.",

The cultivation of rice dates back almost 10,000 years in Asia, and forms the core of an independent origin of civilization, distinct from other Eurasian sites that were all based around wheat/barley and millet. Some scholars hypothesize that the cultivation of rice also supports a distinctive Asian form of society, and mode of historical or technological development, that differs from standard frameworks of ‘Western’ modernization. Today rice is one of the most intensively researched crops, as both a model organism for advanced research in genomics and an important object of genetic modification experiments. We will explore how the cultivation of rice raises exciting and provocative questions about the relationships among society, technology and environment. The course asks whether Asia’s history and culture of rice can provide an alternative figure of technological development and design, and perhaps a model for a sustainable relationship between humans and their natural environments.\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.",

What then are the new issues and challenges for design in the Anthropocene? In this course, existing design theory will be introduced, and explicated in relation to the Anthropocene condition through seven emerging topical issues: (i) designing with living systems 1 (human-beings); (ii) designing with living systems 2 (more-than-human agencies and other ecosystems); (iii) open systems and incomplete design; (iv) large-scale sociotechnical systems 1: Smart Cities; (v) large-scale sociotechnical systems 2: Artificial Intelligence; (vi) large-scale sociotechnical systems 3: Climate change adaptations; (vii) design ethics.\n*Note: With the current CoV19 situation, the entire course and assessment will be online.",
